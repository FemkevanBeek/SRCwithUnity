# SRCwithUnity
Unity projects for working with the SRC.
- "Communication only" is a basic project which only facilitates communication with Simulink/Matlab via TCP/IP.
- "Teleoperation" and "VR_Haptics" can be used for use cases 2 and 3.
All these projects work together with the rest of the software present on: https:\\github.com\chukhanhhoang\SoftRoboticSetupFesto\software\examples\FestoSetupWithUnity.

Within each project, import settings can be set in the Settings scripts directly from the main Unity interface. For each setting, a tooltip description of the setting is provided when hovering.
